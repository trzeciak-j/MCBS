This project aims to explore the relationship between gut microbiota and host gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by integrating 16S rRNA sequencing data with liver RNA-seq data.

This project is based on the study by Huang et al. (2020), available at [Genome Medicine](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-020-00796-5).

## Required libraries
```{r libraries, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
#if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#    install.packages("BiocManager")
